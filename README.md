### There are several supervised machine learning models that can be used for the Titanic dataset, depending on the problem you're trying to solve. Here are a few examples:

    - Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a simple and interpretable model that can be used for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a passenger survived or not.
    - Decision Trees: Decision Trees are simple to understand and interpret, they can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They can handle categorical and numerical data, and they are insensitive to outliers.
    - Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to make a more accurate and stable prediction. It is also a versatile algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
    - Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs are a powerful and effective model for binary classification problems, such as predicting survival on the Titanic. They can model non-linear decision boundaries and are robust to overfitting.
    - Gradient Boosting: Gradient Boosting is another ensemble method that builds multiple weak models and merges them together to make a more accurate and stable prediction. It can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
- It is also important to note that, the model selection should depend on the data and the problem you are trying to solve, and it's important to evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and pick the one that performs best.
